PLUGIN PARAMETERS (PlParam)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

PlParam "name" "my-name.mesh"
	the name of this OLSR node (main address).
	can be specified multiple times for different names.

PlParam "IP.ADDR" "another-name.mesh"
	a name for a specified IP address.
	the IP address has to be either from one of the olsr 
	interfaces or within a HNA network we announce.
	can be specified multiple times.

PlParam "hosts-file" "/path/to/hosts_file"
	which file to write to (usually /etc/hosts).
	(default: /var/run/hosts_olsr)

PlParam "suffix" ".olsr"
	local suffix which is appended to all received names.
	(default: "")

PlParam "add-hosts" "/path/to/file"
	copy contents of this additional hosts file to output file.
	this is practical if you alreay use your /etc/hosts file.

PlParam "dns-server" "IP.ADDR"
	anounce that this IP has a full (upstream) DNS server. if 
	IP.ADDR is not specified (""), the main address is used.
	nodes which don't know a nameserver will automatically use
	this nameserver.

PlParam "resolv-file" "/path/to/resolv.conf"
	path to resolv.conf file (usually /etc/resolv.conf)
	if set, the 3 nearest (best ETX) upstream nameservers annonced 
	by other nodes in the network are written to this file

PlParam "interval" "SEC"
	interval for sending NAME messages in seconds.
	(default: 120 - 2 minutes)

PlParam "timeout" "SEC"
	validity time for received NAME messages in seconds.
	(default: 3600 - 1 hour)

PlParam "lat" "12.123"
	Float: Decimal latitude for this node to be flooded in the mesh

PlParam "lon" "12.123"
	Float: Decimal longitude for this node to be flooded in the mesh

PlParam "latlon-file" "/var/run/latlon.js"
	Filename to write Javascript statements to. Default is "latlon.js"
	(either /var/run or windows directory). This file is written, if
	the "lat" and "lon" parameters are set. It has this format:

	/* One or more mid-aliases of multihomed nodes */
	Mid('fromip','toip');

	/* One special Node() entry for this node
	 * defhna means: This node announces hna 0.0.0.0/0
	 * defroute means: The current neighbour IP for 0.0.0.0/0
	 */
	Self('mainip',lat,lon,defhna?1:0,'defroute','name');

	/* One or more node entires for other nodes */
	Node('mainip',lat,lon,this-node-defhna?1:0,'defroute','name');

	/* One or more links between nodes */
	Link('fromip','toip',lq,nlq,etx);

PlParam "latlon-infile" "name-of-input.txt"
	Filename to read lat/lon positions from. Meant to be used
	by a walking GPS receiver. Just write comma separated decimal
	latitude and longitude to this file. Will overwrite the
	"lat" and "lon" parameters during runtime.

PlParam "sighup-pid-file" "/path/to/pidfile.pid"
        (*nix systems only) Sends a HUP signal to the process specified
        by the pidfile (usually /var/run/dnsmasq.pid) when the host name
        table changes. This is useful for letting dnsmasq or bind know
        they have to reload their hosts file.

PlParam "name-change-script" "/path/to/script"
        Script to execute when there is a change in the hosts names
        table. Useful for executing a script that uses the hosts file
        to keep a website or a database updated.

PlParam "services-change-script" "/path/to/script"
        Similar to the previous parameter. Script to execute when there
        is a change in the services list propagated by the nameserver
        plugin. Useful for executing a script that uses the services file
        to keep a website or a database updated.

SAMPLE CONFIG
---------------------------------------------------------------------

add in /etc/olsrd.conf:

LoadPlugin "olsrd_autoconf.so.0.1"
{
	PlParam "interval" "3.4"
	PlParam "unique_addr" ""
	PlParam "mode" "auto"
}
